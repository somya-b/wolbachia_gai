# **Efficacy of _Wolbachia_-mediated sterility to suppress adult _Aedes aegypti_ populations: a synthetic control study**

Singapore, a tropical and urbanized city state, is highly vulnerable to dengue outbreaks due to a multitude of factors, including a year-round conducive climate for Aedes mosquito breeding and a dense, urban human population. In the absence of effective therapeutics, vector control remains the key approach to prevention. We examine the potential of _Wolbachia_-mediated incompatible insect technique coupled with sterile insect technique for strengthening vector control and reducing dengue incidence in Singapore. Extensive field trials were conducted in four regions of Singapore, starting in 2018. We develop a synthetic control study framework to investigate the effectiveness of releasing _Wolbachia_-infected male _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes in reducing _Ae. aegypti_ abundance in the four trial sites using data from 2019 to 2022. We provide the first critical evidence that releasing Wolbachia-infected male _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes can stem dengue transmission using large-scale field trial data.
